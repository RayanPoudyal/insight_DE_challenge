# Scripts for Insight Data Engineering coding challenge
This GitHub repository contains my solution to the [coding challenge](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/pharmacy_counting) for the Fellows Program organized by [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/).

## Instructions
To execute the script move to the main directory of the project and run the following in the terminal:

```
python ./src/pharmacy_counting.py ./input/itcont.txt ./output/top_cost_drug.txt
```

Last two arguments should be input and output files, respectively.
